# Destack React Starter

This example shows a very basic version of a *Destack* project with React.js and CRA. 

- There's one page, `App.js`, that shows the visual editor (in development) and the compiled version (in production). 
- All the magic is done with the `destack -d` and `destack -b`, that has to be setup once and handles templates saving and loading.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or preview in Gitpod:
